The blunting of the second digit nail may be associated with a chronic infectious or immune-mediated dermatologic condition. Malignant neoplasia or osteomyelitis, however, are considered less likely. Consideration could be given to dermatology consultation. This is also less likely to represent a benign keratoacanthoma. The concavity along the dorsodistal left radius is likely an incidental lesion, possibly due to historical trauma, tendonitis, or an atypical location for historical osteochondritis dissecans. Mild right cranial bronchiectasis, suggestive of chronic or previous lower airway disease with resulting dilation. An ongoing bronchitis is possible and must be correlated with the clinical picture. The interstitial pattern noted in the right cranial lung lobe is likely mostly due to recumbency-associated atelectasis rather than fibrosis or active bronchopneumonia. No evidence of intrathoracic neoplasia. The moderate transient esophageal gas dilation is thought likely due to anesthesia-induced relaxation. Mild pathologic esophageal dysmotility is possible.

Chronic right calcaneal tendonopathy, with a possible acute on chronic injury to the calcaneal tendon. 2. Right tibiotarsal synovitis/synovial effusion. 3. Right lateral tarsal enthesopathy. The changes to the calcaneal tendon and tarsus suggest a chronic strain to the lateral collateral ligament and calcaneal tendon, possibly due to altered or increased weight-bearing given the lack of a left pelvic limb. Given the provided history of acute trauma and lameness, an acute on chronic injury to the tarsus is likely, possibly involving both the lateral collateral ligament and calcaneal tendon.Despite the lack of visualized tarsal instability, I am concerned that tarsal instability may be present.

This bony proliferation is most compatible in appearance with chronic proliferation secondary to intra-articular inflammation. This is not compatible in appearance with synovial neoplasia and therefore a deep synovial biopsy is thought less likely to prove diagnostically helpful. A chronic orthopedic injury such as bilateral hyperextension or flexion injury is highly considered, though, given the concurrent lymphadenopathy identified, an immune-mediated or infectious (vector-borne, unlikely fungal or bacterial) process remains possible as a source of the chronic inflammation. For this reason, the carpal arthrocentesis is recommended as recently performed. Carpal instability is considered unlikely given the lack of subluxation and lack of cuboidal bone bony proliferation. Mild bilateral medial epicondylar flexor enthesopathy, possibly primary rather than concomitant given the lack of other identified elbow lesions. Mild symmetrical caudal superficial cervical and medial retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy. These are likely to represent reactive hyperplasia rather than infiltrative neoplasia, though, a source of reactivity is not definitively identified.

This mass is suspected to be originating from the left medial liver lobe. A focal hypoattenuating nodule measuring 0.8 cm is present containing faint early rim arterial enhancement medial to the neck of the gallbladder and lateral to the central portal branch in the region of the quadrate lobe. There is patchy enhancement within the dorsal mid and right liver on the arterial phase that washes out on the delayed venous phase. The hepatic lymph node medial to the portal vein at the porta hepatis is centrally hypoattenuating and measures on the upper limits of normal at 0.8 cm. Within the tail of the spleen, there is a round discrete 1.6 cm nodule that is markedly enhancing on both phases, most severe on the arterial phase, that causes focal protrusion of the splenic capsule. A smaller 0.7 cm nodule is present in the lateral periphery of the body that is markedly homogenously arterial enhancing and mildly washes out on the delayed venous phase. A fat attenuating poorly defined nodule borders the intrasplenic vein in the body, representing an incidental myelolipoma. The pancreas is normal in size, margin, and enhancement.

Differential diagnoses include benign vacuolar hepatopathy (endocrinopathy such as hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus or exogenous steroid administration, or phenobarbital administration), congestion caused by right-sided cardiac disease, inflammatory hepatopathy/hepatitis, and neoplasia. Findings could be correlated to the patient's biochemical analysis if available. Abdominal ultrasound could be considered to further characterize the liver and allow for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration if indicated. Generalized cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the descending aorta. This may be due to degenerative valvular changes, mild pericardial effusion, acquired cardiomyopathy, or artifact due to the body conformation of the patient. Tortuosity of the aorta has been associated with systemic hypertension. For this reason, consider systemic blood pressure evaluation and also echocardiogram. Chronic C4-5 through C7-T1 intervertebral disc degenerative change. Correlate to the physical examination to determine the significance of this finding. The described clinical signs localize to the upper airways and therefore, these above findings may be unrelated to the presenting complaint.

The left cranial lung lobe cranial subsegment is not definitively visualized in margin, thought effaced by the surrounding pleural fluid and large in size, diffusely fluid-attenuating. A small pinpoint mineral focus is present within the subsegment with a small amount of focal stippled gas within the caudal aspect of this subsegment. The caudal subsegment of the lobe contains focal narrowing of the bronchus near the hilus and is mildly caudally displaced. The right middle lung lobe is decreased in volume and alveolar in pattern. All ventral bronchi are dilated and saccular, failing to taper in the periphery.

Numerous small fragmented foci are present throughout the abdomen located within the small intestine (see annotations). None of these gas foci overtly appear geometric in shape. The descending colon contains a large amount of fecal material. The remainder of the abdomen cannot be assessed. The included caudal thorax and surrounding osseous structures are within normal limits for a patient of this age.,"A definitive source for the poor weight gain is not identified. The small fragmented gas foci suggest abnormal peristalsis, possibly due to an infectious enteritis given the young age (parasitic, protozoal, viral, bacterial), less likely immune-mediated given the young age. A linear foreign body cannot be entirely excluded but is considered less likely given the lack of visualized material in the pylorus and also lack of described severe vomiting. No evidence of a mechanical obstruction is identified. The distended abdomen despite the thin body condition may be due to the young age of the patient or a pathologic volume of peritoneal free fluid. A small volume of peritoneal fluid is expected in juvenile patients. Consider infectious disease testing for causes of enteritis (viral, parasitic, protozoal) and using ultrasound to sample the peritoneal fluid if a moderate to large volume is present for fluid cytology. If vomiting is present, abdominal ultrasound is warranted. Ultimately, internal medicine consultation may be warranted for further workup and recommendations.",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,

This mass contacts the caudal margin of the hard palate and expands both dorsally into the nasopharynx and ventrally into the oral cavity, causing approximately 50% ventrodorsal luminal narrowing of the nasopharynx. This mass contains wispy amorphous internal mineralization within the cranioventral portion.

Pyloric stenosis or gastric hypertrophy is possible though thought less likely given the adult age of the patient. The progressive filling of the gastric lumen on the later series must be correlated to the diet history of the patient and may represent an incidental finding associated with a recent meal, ingesta or mucous associated with gastric ileus, or accumulation of material secondary to a parrtial helpful obstruction that is not evident on the later series. Given the repeated vomiting and lack of a definitive source of clinical signs, further evaluation of the pyloroduodenal junction by a trained sonographer to evaluate gastrointestinal tract after fasting could be considered to evaluate for a subtle mural lesion.

Recommend evaluating the penis and prepuce for an anatomic source of clinical signs as well as urinalysis with urine culture. Castration may help to relieve clinical signs related to the prostate if present. Radiolucent mineralized lower urinary tract material may be present that is not radiographically evident. Consider ultrasound of the urinary bladder and prostate to evaluate for mineralized material. If serial radiographs are elected of the lower urinary tract, it may be helpful to place a radiolucent paddle over the region of the urinary to compress the lumen and remove superimposition of other structures (wooden paddle or spatula).

Peritoneal free fluid and possible concurrent steatitis. Transudate and/or inflammatory effusion caused by the gastrointestinal disease is considered most likely. Given the known hypoproteinemia, transudate due to an enteropathy is highly considered. Consider abdominocentesis with fluid cytology and fasted abdominal ultrasound to characterize the intestinal findings and potential source of the free fluid. Consultation with an internist with additional intestinal diagnostics could also be considered, and ultimately intestinal biopsy may be recommended.",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,

The medial malleolus of the distal right tibia is fractured with sharp margins. This large fragment is bordered by several small osseous foci and focal soft tissue thickening. Small gas foci are present along the superficial aspect of this soft tissue thickening proximally. The adjacent margin of the distal tibia is blunted. There is slight widening of the tibiotarsal joint on the lateral stressed image (see annotation). Small mineral foci are visualized superimposed over the proximal right tibial plateau and distal femoral condyles on the lateral image (see arrows). No other periosteal proliferation or bony changes are identified.,"Mildly comminuted non-displaced fracture of the medial malleolus. The slight widening of the medial tibiotarsal joint space on the stressed image is only slightly more severe than expected in a normal patient. This suggests mild medial instability of the tibiotarsal joint or possibly within normal limits for patient variation. Correlate this to the orthopedic examination to determine if stabilization is warranted given the mild severity widening. The mineral foci superimposed over proximal tibia and distal femur are concerning for several small avulsion or chip fragments, possibly at ligamentous insertions.

It is possible that instead of osteomyelitis, there is instead internal necrosis and hemorrhage associated with the inflammatory reaction. If osteomyelitis is present, it is possible that this is associated with the developmental disease, though the pathophysiology is unclear and is sparsely reported. Prognosis is likely dependent on if infection is present. I suspect there is a focal meningitis present. A secondary encephalitis is also possible though would require MRI for diagnosis. Regardless, after culture, supportive care and monitoring is warranted, with consideration for MRI if neurologic clinical signs develop.

This asymmetry is likely caused by historical trauma and diaphragmatic herniation that has since healed, with possible adhesions to the pericardium and regional lung lobes and body wall. It is possible that the stomach is also cranially displaced along with the diaphragm and left liver, causing atypical positioning to the lower esophageal sphincter and caudal thoracic esophagus. Ideally for confirmation, thoracic CT with contrast enhancement would be performed, though, this may represent currently an incidental finding for the patient as no evidence of a active diaphragmatic hernia is identified (no evidence of pleural effusion, rib fractures, or clinical signs associated with this finding).

The included osseous structures are normal.","The loop of intestine in the left midabdomen is concerning for a small intestinal obstruction or a partially obstructed colon given that the colonic outflow tract cannot be identified and there is significant dilation of this loop. This may represent dilation due to infiltrative mural disease, ischemia, enteritis or colitis, or less likely, a partial volvulus. The severe loss of peritoneal serosal detail is likely to represent peritoneal free fluid. Given the concurrent findings, this is most concerning for neoplastic or inflammatory (septic or nonseptic) fluid. Subjective small intestinal wall thickening, which may represent artifacts due to the surrounding fluid or infiltrative enteropathy, as with acute enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or infiltrative round cell neoplasia.
